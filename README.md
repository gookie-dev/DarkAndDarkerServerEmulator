# DarkAndDarkerServerEmulator

This is a proof of concept that it would be possible to emulate a Dark and Darker server. Please note that I am emulating only a fraction of the server and i even hardcoded that. 

## Try it yourself
Download the [proof-of-concept.zip](https://github.com/gookie-dev/DarkAndDarkerServerEmulator/releases/download/0.1/proof-of-concept.zip) and unpack it into the Dark and Darker Demo folder. Now start the DarkAndDarkerServerEmulator.exe
